Mention Detection Bot

--------------------

An example of how a bot can tell the difference between a member mention and a role mention.
Created mostly for my bud https://github.com/odude102

Basically, member mentions are structured with <@justnumbers>, while roles have <@&plusnumbers>.

There's also a *functioning* version of his bot inside.
